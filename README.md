# Fractal Twitter bot
A twitter bot to post daily pictures of Julia sets. Fractal is generated in bots/julia.py (credit to https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272679245_NumPy_SciPy_Recipes_for_Image_Processing_Creating_Fractal_Images for the inspiration behind this), and then posted using bots/fractal_bot.py.

Also includes a Dockerfile & requirements.txt to be ready for containerisation using Docker.
